# Definition: git status

The **git status** command is useful for identifying changes since your last commit, tells you what changes have been added to the staging area, lets you know if there are untracked files that have not been added to Gits tracking, and tellls you the current branch you are working on.

You can also access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal by using the Git extension panel on the left side of the screen.
